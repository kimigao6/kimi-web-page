		<h2 class="subtitle">The Canon EF 24-70mm f/2.8L II USM lens</h2>
		<img id="lens" src="equ/equ_lens.JPG" alt="EF 24-70mm f/2.8L II USM lens" title="EF 24-70mm f/2.8L II USM lens"
			width="500px" ; />
		<p id="p2">
			The Canon EF 24-70mm f/2.8L II USM lens is great for both everyday photography and professional work. It's
			very
			versatile, meaning you can take wide shots of landscapes or close-up portraits with the same lens. The zoom
			range from 24mm to 70mm lets you capture everything from big, open scenes to detailed shots of people.

			<br />

			What makes this lens stand out is its f/2.8 aperture, which stays the same no matter how much you zoom. This
			feature is perfect for shooting in low light, helping you get clear and bright photos indoors or during the
			evening. It also creates beautiful background blur, making your subjects stand out sharply against a softly
			blurred backdrop, which is ideal for portrait photography.

		<div id="p3">
			<ol>
				<li>
					Using the "M" mode, which stands for Manual mode, on your camera allows you full control over the
					camera
					settings, including aperture, shutter speed, and ISO.
				</li>

				<li>
					In Manual mode, you can adjust the aperture to control the depth of field, which affects how much of
					your
					image
					is in sharp focus. A wider aperture (lower f-number) lets in more light and creates a shallower
					depth of
					field,
					which is great for portraits or when you want to isolate your subject from the background. A smaller
					aperture
					(higher f-number) allows less light but increases the depth of field, keeping more of the scene in
					focus,
					which
					is often desired in landscape photography.
				</li>

				<li>
					Shutter speed adjustment is another critical aspect of Manual mode, allowing you to capture motion
					in
					various
					ways. A faster shutter speed can freeze fast-moving subjects, making it ideal for sports or wildlife
					photography. On the other hand, a slower shutter speed can create a motion blur effect, perfect for
					conveying
					movement in waterfalls or cityscapes at night.
				</li>

				<li>
					Finally, by manually setting the ISO, you can control the camera's sensitivity to light. A lower ISO
					is
					used
					in
					bright conditions to produce the highest quality images with minimal noise. A higher ISO is helpful
					in
					low
					light
					situations but can introduce noise or grain into your images.
				</li>

				<li>
					By using Manual mode and adjusting these settings based on my understanding and the photo's
					requirements, I
					have
					the creative freedom to achieve the exact look and feel I desire for my images.
				</li>
